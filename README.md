# Data Analysis Portfolio 1
This is a collection of portfolio projects developed by me alongside Alex the Analyst on YouTube. This portfolio represents my understanding of Data Analysis basics like pattern discovery, data cleaning, and correlation discovery throughSQL, Tableau, Excel, and Jupyter Notebooks. This also demonstrates my ability to find new data patterns, shown in the Covid data project 
where I look into the influence of the Human Development Index on different countries.

 ## Covid Data Analysis
An SQL project using Covid vaccination and death data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). This project showcases skills like aggregate functions, joining tables, and creating CTEs and views. [CovidData.sql](CovidData.sql) includes all of the queries I made while analyzing the data. While [CovidDataEdited.sql](CovidDataEdited.sql) contains all the queries I used for Tableau data visualization.

 ## Covid Data Visualization
 Below are links to my two Tableau dashboards for the SQL projects referenced above. [Dashboard 1](https://public.tableau.com/shared/D7W3YR8ST?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) contains tables relating to infections and deaths globally. [Dashboard 2](https://public.tableau.com/shared/5X9DCCC92?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) looks at the Human Development Index and its relation to life expectency for people infected with Covid.

_Please note this data may not be accurate to data discovered today, as the provided data set is from 2020 to 2021._

 ## Data Cleaning
Another SQL focusing on data cleaning by checking for null values and duplicates. As well as data formatting: such as formatting a "Dates" column to fit the MM-DD-YYYY format, and splitting adress columns to be separated into a more readable format. The dataset is Nashville housing data.

 ## Data Correlation
 Python project in Jupyter Notebook. Using libraries like matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and seaborn to create scatterplots and heatmaps to find correlations in a dataset focusing on movies. The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
