# Data Analysis Portfolio 1
This is a collection of portfolio projects developed by me alongside Alex the Analyst on YouTube. This portfolio represents my understanding of Data Analysis basics like pattern discovery, data cleaning, and correlation discovery throughSQL, Tableau, Excel, and Jupyter Notebooks. This also demonstrates my ability to find new data patterns, shown in the Covid data project 
where I look into the influence of the Human Development Index on different countries.
