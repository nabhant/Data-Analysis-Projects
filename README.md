# Data Analysis Portfolio 1
This is a collection of portfolio projects developed by me alongside Alex the Analyst on YouTube. This portfolio represents my understanding of Data Analysis basics like pattern discovery, data cleaning, and correlation discovery throughSQL, Tableau, Excel, and Jupyter Notebooks. This also demonstrates my ability to find new data patterns, shown in the Covid data project 
where I look into the influence of the Human Development Index on different countries.

 ## Covid Data Analysis
SQL project using Covid vaccination and death data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). This project showcases skills like aggregate functions, joining tables, and creating CTEs and views. [CovidData.sql](Data-Analysis-Projects/CovidData.sql) includes all of the queries I made while analyzing data. While [CovidDataEdited.sql](Data-Analysis-Projects/CovidDataEdited.sql) contains all the queries used for Tableau data visualization.
